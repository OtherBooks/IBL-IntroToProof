# Contributing #

I would love to see people contributing to this project. In particular, I'm looking for folks to contribute to the following items:

  1. A section on partially order sets (see [Issue 60](https://github.com/dcernst/IBL-IntroToProof/issues/60))
  2. Intersperse more historical tidbits (see [Issue 49](https://github.com/dcernst/IBL-IntroToProof/issues/49))
  3. Add some discussion about Axiom of Choice (see [Issue 50](https://github.com/dcernst/IBL-IntroToProof/issues/50))
  4. Add section on Schroder-Bernstein (see [Issue 51](https://github.com/dcernst/IBL-IntroToProof/issues/51))
  5. Add section/discussion about continuum hypothesis (see [Issue 52](https://github.com/dcernst/IBL-IntroToProof/issues/52))

Check out the other [issues](https://github.com/dcernst/IBL-IntroToProof/issues/) for ways to contribute.
