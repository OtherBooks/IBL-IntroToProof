\begin{itemize}
\item Page x, line $-5$: Replaced ``undoubtably" with ``undoubtedly". Although, perhaps the former is acceptable. [Pietro Monticone]
\item Page 54, Theorem~4.2: It would be nice if Item~(ii) began ``for all $k\geq 1$".  This is an instance of an implicit universal quantifier for a conditional statement.  In this case, the implicit universe of discourse is the set of natural numbers.  However, including ``for all $k\geq 1$," leads to a nice parallelism with Theorem~4.9. [Ben Ford]
\item Page 56, Theorem~4.9: Item~(ii) should start with ``for all $k\geq a$,". [Ben Ford]
\item Page 57, Skeleton Proof~4.10: In Item~(ii), it should say ``For all $k\geq a$, if $P(k)$ is true, then $P(k+1)$ is true." as opposed to ``For all $k\in\mathbb{Z}\ldots$" [Ben Ford]
\item Page 60, Problem~4.33: In Item~(i), the final string is missing a leading one.  It should be ``$011101 \to 111101$". [Ben Ford]
\item Page 63, line 1: Missing the word ``the" between ``into" and ``structure". 
\item Page 82, line $-1$: ``counterexample" should be replaced with ``contradiction". 
\item Page 105, Corollary~7.74: As stated the corollary is incorrect. However, including the hypothesis ``$a\in\rel(a)$ for all $a\in A$" makes the statement true. However, I think it is incorrect to refer to this result as a ``Corollary", so it has been renamed ``Theorem". As a result, the reference to the result in Example~7.80 and the paragraph prior to Theorem~7.81 have been updated. [Blake Farman]
\item Page 106, Example~7.80 and paragraph prior to Theorem~7.81: ``Corollary~7.74" replaced with ``Theorem~7.74."
\item Page 128, Problem~8.66: It is impossible to find an example for Part~(a) with the given sets.  ``Let $X=\{a,b\}$ and $Y=\{1,2\}$'' has been replaced with ``Complete each of the following. Consider using finite sets and drawing a function diagram to define your functions.'' [Blake Farman]
\item Page 131, line 7: Corrected the spelling of ``Definition." [Pietro Monticone]
\item Page 158, line 1: Missing the word ``look" between ``you" and ``at". [Roy St.~Laurent]
\item Page 161, line 11: Removed spurious ``$)$". [Pietro Monticone]
