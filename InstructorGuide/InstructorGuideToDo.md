## Instructor Guide

### General
[ ] For theorems with multiple similar parts, perhaps ask students to only prove one part. Example: Generalized Distribution of Union and Intersection.
[ ] Even though this is never mentioned in book, instructors should emphasize data type as a way of conceptualizing what's going on?  Ever present question: What is the data type of this object?  Can that data type have property X?

### Chapter 2
[x] Attempt to cover Chapter 2 as fast as possible.
[x] Discuss issues that arise beginning of Chapter 2. For example: equivalent forms of even vs odd, even/odd integer vs even/odd number, divides vs divided by, etc.
[x] One detail that I sweep under the rug is that we discuss the truth value of conditional propositions in Definition 2.18 and then take for granted that we can apply the same structure to conditional statements involving predicates. My personal take is that I don't want to get bogged down in these sorts of pedantic details, but in thinking about it carefully now, I do think this discussion is at least worthy of a remark in the book.

### Chapter 3
[x] Paradoxes (Section 3.2) could be skipped.

### Chapter 4
[x] Don't have to do all the induction problems.  It's a good idea for instructor to do first couple to set the standard for what the proofs should look like.
[x] Choose any 3 of Theorems 4.13-4.23.
[x] Discuss how to interpret the occurrence of P(n) in the skeleton proof for induction. Don't have students write P(n)!

### Chapter 5
[x] The generalization of the WOP given in \textbf{Theorem~4.40} is needed in the proof of \textbf{Theorem~5.46}.

### Chapter 6
[ ] The Well-Ordering Principle is needed in the proofs of \textbf{Theorems~6.6}, \textbf{6.7}, and \textbf{6.13}. Note that I have included the proof of \textbf{Theorem~6.7} (Division Algorithm) in Chapter~6.
