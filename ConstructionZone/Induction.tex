\chapter{Induction}

In this chapter, we introduce mathematical induction, which is a proof technique that is useful for proving statements of the form $(\forall n \in \mathbb{N})P(n)$, or more generally $(\forall n \in \mathbb{Z})(n\geq a\implies P(n))$, where $P(n)$ is some predicate and $a \in \mathbb{Z}$.
