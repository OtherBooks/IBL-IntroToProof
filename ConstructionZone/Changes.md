# Specific Changes

## General Changes

- Added page numbers.
- Rewrote most theorem statements in the form "If..., then..." as opposed to "Let... . Then ...".
- Added more history on Russell's Paradox, made this a stand alone section, and moved the additional paradoxes to an appendix.
- Converted all "Exercise" and "Question" types to "Problem".
- Added formal statement of Axiom of Choice to end of section on indexing sets.
- Moved the definition of set of relatives up a section.
- Moved discussion of Cartesian products of sets to its own section.
- Lots of changes, additions, improvements to Chapters 6 and 7.  Too numerous to list.
- Replaced most occurrences of $\sim$ that were used to represent an arbitrary relation with $R$.  The symbol $\sim$ occurs only when have an equivalence relation.
- Changed notation for set of relatives from [a] to rel(a) as [a] was somewhat non-standard in situations when relation is not an equivalence relation.
- Added some discussion of well-defined functions to the end of Section 7.1.
- Replaced most occurrences of one-to-one and onto with injective and surjective.
- Moved the content on injective and surjective to its own section.
- Added several new figures to the chapters on relations and functions.

## Reviewer 1

- Section 1.7: My students are helped by an encouragement to rewrite, if necessary, a theorem statement in the form of “If p, then q.” Describe this idea. Consider recommending every theorem be rewritten in this way before starting a proof. In fact, a step-by-step process to deliver a proof might be helpful. Also, try something else that is still fanciful instead of “kick some butt!”
    * Todo.
- Just before Definition 2.1 add, “...or, equivalently “n ∈ Z.”
    * I don't understand this suggestion.
- Section 2.3: Revise “...it never be both.”
    * Done.
- Exercise 2.68. The instructions are not clear. What does “Discuss the meaning of...” mean? Revise.
    * I hope that my fix is sufficient.
- Section 3.1: The order of the bulleted sets could be revised so that they progress as nested. Then this can have powerful consequences in a student’s thinking of these sets for modern algebraic considerations.
    * Done.
- Exercise 3.3. Clarity needed. What is a “simple description”?
    * Todo.
- Definition 3.33. Something more is needed. Maybe insert “We read this as...” before the boxed formulas? Also, in the bullets preceding the definition, revise to ...“the set of S-sub-alpha, taken over alpha in Delta.”
    * Todo.
- Section 8.1: This is a spot where lots and lots and lots of examples would help. Expand the ideas to sets of non-numeric structures. Non-real sets. Such as the set of stars or the set of dog types recognized by AKC or the set of subsets of {Mom, Dad, Tracy}.
    * Done.

## Reviewer 3

- Introduction p. 6 “Up to this point it is likely...” that seems like a sweeping generalization perhaps tone it down to it is possible or something more likely to be true.
- “As the instructor I am here” This shows the author didn’t bother to edit the book before sending it in - obviously the author was the instructor in his own class, but will not be the instructor for those who use this as a textbook.
    * This will get addressed with overall re-voicing.
- “Our focus in this class is learning to DO mathematics, not learning to sit patiently while others do it.” Again this is pedantic and more fitting for a blog than a published text. This type of tone claiming to be better at teaching math than everyone you’ve had before pervades the introduction and is pretentious.
    * I'll likely ignore this.
- p. 7 “I use the word produce...” One of many, many times 1st person is used when a more professional voice should be used. ( I won’t list all the others).
    * This will get addressed with overall re-voicing.
- p. 11 “Now go have fun and kick some butt!” Again not fitting for a publication.
    * This will get addressed with overall re-voicing. But I'll ignore either way.
- p. 12 “one of the issues we will bump into knowing” insert the word is before knowing.
    * Done.
- p. 12 on, It seems like it would be very helpful to have a few proofs for students to model their work on before we expect them to prove theorems out of the blue.
    * Perhaps, but this is intentional.
- p. 13 by this time the writing is improving and getting far more professional.
    * Nothing to address.
- p. 15 skeleton of proof - this is good and more like this before the theorems would
be helpful.
    * Nothing to address.
- p. 17 “The items below can be assembled...” Again, this is much better, very helpful.
    * Nothing to address.
- p. 17 Theorem 2.49-2.51 these are good ideas.
    * Nothing to address.
- p 19 “Skeleton Proof” : it would be nice to follow the skeletons of proofs or replace them at times in the book by some worked out examples.
    * Hopefully this will be addressed by adding more examples throughout.
- p. 19 “The sentence x > 0” : ideally change this to “The sentence x > 0.” since without the period it is not actually a sentence and it helps point out that proper grammar should be used in math.
    * Done.
- p. 27 Exercises 3.3 -3.4 good.
    * Nothing to address.
- p 27 “Every set always has two rather boring subsets.” The empty set does not.
    * Fixed.
- p. 27 Def 3.10 A also must not be the emptyset.
    * No, I'm taking the point of view that the empty set is a proper subset of every non-empty set.
- p. 29 Conjecture 3.23 This should be an exercise or question not really a conjecture.
    * Agreed. Fixed.
- p. 30 Problem 3.28-3.30 Well done. Problem 3.32 is good, too.
    * Nothing to address.
- P 35 It makes more sense to do Theorem 3.54 and Exercise 3.55 in the opposite order or the exercise is trivial.
    * I'm not sure I understand this comment.  Perhaps the reviewer assumed that I'm only considering bounded open intervals.
- p. 35 Exercise 3.61 probably should swap part a and b so the easier one is first. 10
    * Done.
- p. 36 Exercise 3.72 a-d is nice.
    * Nothing to address.
- Jumping ahead to chapter 5. The writing continues to get better here.
    * Nothing to address.
- p. 48 ”While you would lose points for such a proof in this class...” Again the author is not teaching the class and this should be fixed.
    * This will get addressed with re-voicing.
- Appendix A is quite good. (Appendix B and C are fine, too).
    * Nothing to address.

## Reviewer 4

- The text seems like it would be a good offering for a seasoned IBL instructor, but a less experienced instructor may have difficulty predicting where students are likely to have difficulties in the course.
    * Perhaps addressed with Instructor Guide.
- My main hesitation related to the text is that there is very little motivation given to the students for why formal proofs and rigor are important.
    * Hopefully addressed additional motivation and exposition.
- One challenge I have had in evaluating IBL books is that it can be difficult to judge which exercises can be skipped without affecting later exercises or which ones are required for later topics.
    * Perhaps addressed with Instructor Guide.
- Chapter 1 will need to be substantially revised since most of it is directed for specific course structure, including references to the portion of grade, etc.
    * Will be addressed with re-voicing.
- Some chapters have very good introductions motivating the topics, including Chapters 2 and 8, but others have minimal motivation before diving into the content, including Chapters 5 and 6. On a related note, I would like to see a little more “connective tissue” tying the chapters together. For example, why does Chapter 5 appear where it does? What is the purpose of Chapter 6?
    * Some of this will be addressed with adding motivation and context.
- I think there needs to be some intuition in Definition 2.26(d) for why “If A, then B” is a true statement if A is false. I have found this to be one area where students often have quite a bit of initial confusion.
    * Todo
- I was a little confused about Definition 2.35 which seems to equate “if and only if” with “logically equivalent” even then though the if-and-only-if terminology has been used in in Definition 2.26.
    * Todo. I agree that there is something to be done here. Perhaps move to Definition 2.26.
- In Section 2.4, I found the use of function notation to describe predicates a little confusing. What is the domain? What is the range? Given that Chapter 7 is devoted to functions, this struck me as a little odd.
    * Todo. It's just notation, but I agree that I should specify what the notation means (and maybe not reference function notation).
- In Lemmas 5.4 and 5.10 and in Theorem 8.24, I found labeling the extensive footnotes as “Hints” to be slightly misleading. It seems like these activities would be better described as a fill-in-the-details exercise where the hints are included in the body of the text.
    * This suggestion clashes with another reviewer's comment who liked the footnotes.
- As an extremely minor note, the page numbers missing from most pages. I suspect this is a simple typesetting fix.
    * Fixed.

## Reviewer 5

- This text is very much written from the author to his students, and is very specific to the author’s class set-up and preferences. To make this text more broadly useable will require some conscientious editing and perhaps a collaborator to provide the perspective of a different instructor using this text for the first time, to help supply the content that such an instructor will need to use the text effectively.
    * This will get addressed with overall re-voicing.
- There is not much support for the instructor, as a consequence of the author’s explicit assumption that the author is the instructor.
    * Perhaps addressed with Instructor Guide.
- Please include page numbers beyond the first page of a chapter. It was so hard to keep track of place.
    * Done.
- It would be good to have some instructor notes, describing the premises that the author lays out in Chapter 1 for the students but for the instructor. How should an instructor use this text? How could an instructor use this text? What points should the instructor be sure to discuss with the students?
   * Perhaps addressed with Instructor Guide.
- I think the text would benefit from a conclusion. What is the final message that the author wants to send students away from, at the end of this arduous journey? What have students achieved over the course of working through this text? The introduction is so well done, I’m confident the author can produce a well done conclusion to match.
   * Todo.
- I appreciated the diagrams, and I would like to see more. This is always tricky in a textbook. The quotes in the introductory chapter worked well to break up the blocks of text. Here are some ideas for insertions to continue that trend through the later chapters.
      * I added several new figures.
    - Include more quotes!
      * Todo
    - Include proofs by picture, as food for thought. Clearly state that these are not proofs, but might be good ideas to work off. For instance, I know there’s a proof by picture showing the development of the formula of the sum of the triangular numbers. That would be good in the induction section.
    - Play off the colloquial nature of some of the exercises and examples.
       * Todo.
- There are a few “missed opportunities” where the author could encourage the reader to play and explore, building his/her own conclusion. Of course, having open-ended problems can lead to false conclusions; hiding answers to open-ended problems would be ok. Put them at the end of the chapter, perhaps.
       * Todo.
- The author might consider adding chapters on other topics that are commonly covered in an introduction to proof course, such as beginning graph theory, a brief introduction to sequences and recurrence relations, and introductory combinatorics and discrete probability.
       * ??? Not sure I want to go there.  I could add "counting" easily as Stephanie wrote something already.
- Many education majors with math concentrations take an introduction to proof course and might benefit from exercises or problems that ask students to think about a concept from the perspective of a younger learner. For example, I can see having a few questions about negating inequalities, followed up with questions requesting a paragraph explanation to another person why the negation of x < a is x = a or x>a, and how to negate a<x<b (for some variable x). (This is kind of a stretch from my area of expertise, but this sort of exercise has been mentioned to me as being beneficial to education majors.) Occasional paragraph explanations might be suitable.
      * Todo. Adding the question about negating inequalities is a good idea.
- The text has a small typos that don’t impact the overall meaning and value of the text, but will be tricky/tedious to hunt down and fix. In some cases, little words like “is” are missing or repeated (e.g., “the the”) or words are misspelled but correct in some other context/meaning (e.g., “our” became “out”).
      * Hopefully, I'll hunt these down.  All "the the" and "out" vs "our" instances have been fixed.
- Some of the hints for Chapter 5 are extensive. If the problems can’t be stepped out further to avoid such hints, it would be good to hide the hints at the back of the chapter. The footnotes detract from the text, and intimidate the reader.
      * This clashes with comments from another reviewer.  Feedback I've had in the past is that the footnotes are useful. But I'm open to do something else.
- p. 6, paragraph 4: What if the instructor doesn’t structure their class the way the author does? This description is specific to the author’s classes.
      * This will get addressed when Intro gets retooled.
- p. 10, Subsection 1.5: Again, the language is specific to the author’s classes. The “me” is the author, not the student’s instructor. I love the sentiment and the phrase, “earnest failure outweighs counterfeit success,” is everything a teacher wants to hear.
      * This will get addressed when Intro gets retooled.
- p. 11, paragraph 2: Referencing by number alone really shouldn’t be encouraged in general, since an instructor may or may not have additional results or alternate numbering. In fact, this instruction to the reader directly contradicts the Style Guide #2 in Appendix A. To be more general, encourage students to summarize the result in addition to referencing by number – as well as be reminded that different sources will have different numbering for the same results.
      * Todo.
- p. 11, last sentence: “Now, go have some fun and kick some butt!” – I appreciate the sentiment, but whose butt is getting kicked? How about something less colloquial and more lasting, like “Now, go have some fun and explore mathematics!”?
      * Done.
- Section 2.1, paragraph 1, sentence 3: “Because you are so familiar with properties of integers, one of the issues that we will bump into is knowing which facts . . . ” – insert “is”
      * Done.
- Section 2.1, paragraph 1, last sentence: What discussion is planned? Does the instructor know what the discussion should include?
      * I removed the corresponding sentence.
- Section 2.1, paragraph 3, sentence 1: “Recall . . . ” – From when? Better just to state. Depending on the course, students may actually be seeing ∈ for the first time.
      * Fixed and elaborated on its use.
- p. 14, footnote: “Definition 2.41” should be “Definition 2.39”.
      * Fixed.
- Definition 3.5: “. . . every element of A is also an element of B.” My students often abuse this definition by trying to prove that A ⊆ B by showing x ∈ A and x ∈ B for all x ∈ A. Please just leave out the “also” in the definition. You and I know that it’s ok, but students get confused between “and” and “if . . . then,” and easily, so steer clear of anything that sounds like “and” (such as “also”) in the definition and discussion of a subset.
     * Fixed.
- Theorem 3.19 and Theorem 3.20: After each the equality in each (a), insert “, and” to make the sentence grammatically correct.
     * Fixed and made similar changes in other locations.
- Theorem 3.26/Problem 3.27: This is entirely personal preference, but perhaps an interesting suggestion to consider. How about make these two one problem – ask students to explore the relationship between P(S) ∪ P(T ) and P(S ∪ T ), determine the relationship, and prove that they are precisely correct? Exploration is part of the goal here, and this is a fun problem for exploring and building a better understanding of power sets.
     * Todo.
- Paragraph following Problem 3.27: “We now turn out attention . . . ” should be “We now turn our attention . . . ”
    * Already fixed.
- Definition 3.39/Exercise 3.40/Exercise 3.41: Again, personal preference. Students benefit from playing around with infinite indexing sets. How about encourage that in Exercises 3.40 and 3.41? Possibly in the context of R, such as “provide an example of ...” with multiple parts, including
    - a collection of three sets such that the collection is not pairwise disjoint, the union equals R, and the intersection of the collection equals ∅;
    - a collection of infinitely many sets such that the collection is not pairwise dis- joint, the union equals R, and the intersection of the collection equals ∅; and
    - a collection of infinitely many sets such that the collection is pairwise disjoint, the union equals R, and the intersection of the collection equals ∅.
    * Todo.
- Some of the hints here were expansive. Understandably so – the work is not easy and some guidance is needed. Nonetheless, such expansive hints are overwhelming and make it seem like the problems are too hard. Either step these theorems, etc. out more or put the hints at the end of the chapter and not as footnotes to avoid overwhelming a reader.
    * This clashes with comments from another reviewer.  Feedback I've had in the past is that the footnotes are useful. But I'm open to do something else.
- Example 6.24 breaks one of the rules for style; it is not considered good style to start a sentence with a symbol. This occurs three times, and it’s quite striking.
    * Addressed this here and in the previous definition.
- I appreciated the variety in the examples of relations and equivalence relations throughout Chapter 6.
    * Nothing to address.
- I would like to see Proof Skeletons for proving a relation is reflexive, proving a relation is symmetric, and proving a relation is transitive. Particularly, students struggle with the reflexive property and proving that a relation is reflexive so that proof skeleton would be quite useful – but then, it would look weird not to include the others, too.
    * Done.
- Section 6.3, Exercises 6.46 - 6.50: Again, personal preference: I think it is good for students to wrestle with collections of subsets of R, and it may be good to ask a question along the lines of, “For each of the following collections of subsets of R, decide (and support your decision with a proof or counterexample) whether or not the collection is a partition of R.”
    * I added several new problems and tweaked the relevant sections that should address this item.
- In Section 7.1, I would like to see proof skeletons for the proofs that a function is surjective and that a function is injective. Students really struggle with surjectivity proofs so providing a clear skeleton here would be very beneficial. Students also consistently mix up the definitions of injective and function so again, a skeleton can help set the structure of the proof and how provide some fodder for discussion about how the proofs for injectivity and “function-ness” differ.
    * Done.
- Again, I appreciate the variety of examples of functions in this chapter.
    * Nothing to address.

Appendix A
- Paragraph 2: “I may refer . . . ” The instructor may not appreciate this comment.
    * I removed the corresponding sentence.
- Item 7: The statement breaks rule 4, that it is bad style to start a sentence with a symbol.
    * Fixed.
- Item 8: Include quantifiers and other logic symbols in the “avoid in formal write-ups” pile.(∀,∃,∨,∧,and ⇐⇒)
    * Done. I added a new item for this one.
- Item 13: I love this! I call it “bad math.” I’d like to see the backwards example written correctly, as a demonstration.
    * Done.
- Item 15: Thank you.
     * Nothing to address.
- Item 22: Thank you.
    * Nothing to address.

Appendix C
- Paragraph 4, sentence 3: “Contrast the OED’s descriptive definition of continuous with the the definition of... ” – strike the second “the”
    * Fixed.


## Instructor Guide

- Discuss issues that arise beginning of Chapter 2. For example: equivalent forms of even vs odd, even/odd integer vs even/odd number, divides vs divided by, etc.
- Paradoxes could be skipped.
