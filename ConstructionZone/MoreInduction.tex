\begin{section}{More on Induction}

In the previous section, we discussed proving statements of the form $(\forall n \in \mathbb{N}) P(n)$. Mathematical induction can actually be used to prove a broader family of results; namely, those of the form
\begin{center}
$(\forall n \in \mathbb{Z})(n \geq a \implies P(n))$
\end{center}
for any value $a \in \mathbb{Z}$. Theorem~\ref{thm:PMI} handles the special case when $a = 1$.  The ladder analogy from the previous section holds for this more general situation, too.

\begin{theorem}[Principle of Mathematical Induction]\label{thm:PMI2}
Let $P(a), P(a+1), P(a+2), \ldots$ be a sequence of statements, one for each integer greater than or equal to $a$. Assume that
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textrm{(\roman*)}]
\item $P(a)$ is true, and
\item if $P(k)$ is true, then $P(k+1)$ is true.
\end{enumerate}
Then $P(n)$ is true for all integers $n \geq a$.\footnote{\emph{Hint:} Mimic the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:PMI}, but this time use the set $S=\{k\in \mathbb{N}\mid P(a+k-1) \text{ is true}\}$.}
\end{theorem}

Theorem~\ref{thm:PMI2} gives a process for proving statements of the form: ``For all integers $n\geq a$, $P(n)$.'' As before, hypothesis (i) is called the \textbf{base step}, and (ii) is called the \textbf{inductive step}.

\begin{skeleton}[Proof of $(\forall n \in \mathbb{Z})(n \geq a \implies P(n))$ by Induction]
Here is the general structure for a proof by induction when the base case does not necessarily involve $a=1$.

\begin{center}
\framebox{
\begin{minipage}{6in}
\vspace{.1in}
\begin{proof}
We proceed by induction.
\begin{enumerate}\setlength{\itemsep}{0in}
\item[(i)] Base step: \emph{[Verify that $P(a)$ is true. This often, but not always, amounts to plugging $n=a$ into two sides of some claimed equation and \underline{verifying} that both sides are actually equal.]}

\item[(ii)] Inductive step:  \emph{[Your goal is to prove ``For all $k\in\mathbb{Z}$, if $P(k)$ is true, then $P(k+1)$ is true.'']} Let $k \ge a$ be an integer and assume that $P(k)$ is true. \emph{[Do something to derive that $P(k+1)$ is true.]} Therefore, $P(k+1)$ is true.
\end{enumerate}
Thus, by induction, $P(n)$ is true for all integers $n \ge a$.
\end{proof}
\end{minipage}

\begin{theorem}
Let $A$ be a finite set with $n$ elements.  Then $\mathcal{P}(A)$ is a set with $2^{n}$ elements.\footnote{We encountered this theorem back in Section~\ref{sec:PowerSets} (see Conjecture~\ref{conjecture:PowerSets}), but we didn't prove it. If you prove this theorem using induction, at some point, you will need to argue that if you add one more element to a finite set, then you end up with twice as many subsets. Also, notice that $A$ may have 0 elements.}

\begin{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
For all integers $n \ge 1$, $\displaystyle{\frac{1}{1\cdot 2} + \frac{1}{2\cdot 3} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n(n+1)} = \frac{n}{n+1}}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
For all integers $n \ge 1$, $\displaystyle{\frac{1}{1\cdot 3} + \frac{1}{3\cdot 5} + \frac{1}{5\cdot7} + \cdots + \frac{1}{(2n-1)(2n+1)} = \frac{n}{2n+1}}$.
\end{theorem}

\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
For all integers $n \ge 2$, $2\cdot 9^n - 10 \cdot 3^n$ is divisible by $4$.
\end{theorem}

We now consider an induction problem of a different sort, where you have to begin with some experimentation.

DOUBLE CHECK THIS PROBLEM.  MAYBE A CLOSED FORM IS MORE NATURAL.

\begin{problem}
For any $n \in \mathbb{N}$, say that $n$ straight lines are ``safely drawn in the plane'' if no two of them are parallel and no three of them meet in a single point. Let $S(n)$ be the number of regions formed when $n$ straight lines are safely drawn in the plane.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textrm{(\alph*)}]
\item Compute $S(1)$, $S(2)$, $S(3)$, and $S(4)$.
\item Conjecture a recursive formula for $S(n)$. That is, find a formula for $S(n)$ that involves some of the previous terms $S(n-1), S(n-2)$, etc. If necessary, first compute a few more values of $S(n)$.
\item Prove your conjecture.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
