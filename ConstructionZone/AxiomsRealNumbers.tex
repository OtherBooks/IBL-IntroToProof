\begin{section}{Axioms of the Real Numbers}\label{sec:AxiomsRealNumbers}

Our axioms for the real numbers fall into three categories:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Field Axioms:} These axioms provide the essential properties of arithmetic involving addition and subtraction.
\item \textbf{Order Axioms:} These axioms provide the necessary properties of inequalities.
\item \textbf{Completeness Axiom:} This axiom guarantees that the familiar number line representing the real numbers does not have any ``gaps". We will introduce this axiom in the next section.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{fieldaxioms}\label{axiom:field axioms}
There exist functions $(a,b)\mapsto a+b$ and $(a,b)\mapsto ab$ from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}$ satisfying:
\begin{enumerate}%[label=\textrm{(\roman*)}]
\item[(F1)] (Associativity for Addition) For all $a, b, c\in \mathbb{R}$ we have $(a+b)+c = a+(b+c)$;
\item[(F2)] (Commutativity for Addition) For all $a,b\in \mathbb{R}$, we have $a+b=b+a$;
\item[(F3)] (Additive Identity) There exists $0\in\mathbb{R}$ such that for all $a\in\mathbb{R}$, $0+a=a$;
\item[(F4)] (Additive Inverses) For all $a\in\mathbb{R}$ there exists $-a\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $a+(-a)=0$;

\item[(F5)] (Associativity for Multiplication) For all $a, b, c\in \mathbb{R}$ we have $(ab)c = a(bc)$;
\item[(F6)] (Commutativity for Multiplication) For all $a,b\in \mathbb{R}$, we have $ab=ba$;
\item[(F7)] (Multiplicative Identity) There exists $1\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $1\neq 0$ and for all $a\in\mathbb{R}$, $1a=a$;
\item[(F8)] (Multiplicative Inverses) For all $a\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}$ there exists $a^{-1}\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $aa^{-1}=1$.
\item[(F9)] (Distributive Property) For all $a,b,c\in \mathbb{R}$, $a(b+c)=ab+ac$;
\end{enumerate}
\end{fieldaxioms}

In the language of abstract algebra, Axioms (F1)--(F4) and (F5)--(F8) make each of $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}$ an abelian group under addition and multiplication, respectively. Axiom~(F9) provides a way for the operations of addition and multiplication to interact.  Collectively, Axioms~(F1)--(F9) make the real numbers a \textbf{field}.  It follows from the axioms that the elements $0$ and $1$ of $\mathbb{R}$ are the unique \textbf{additive} and \textbf{multiplicative identities} in $\mathbb{R}$. To prove the following theorem, suppose $0$ and $0'$ are both additive identities in $\mathbb{R}$ and then show that $0=0'$. This shows that there can only be one additive identity. Whether you approach this as a proof by contradiction is a matter of taste. 

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:unique additive identity}
The additive identity of $\mathbb{R}$ is unique.
\end{theorem}

To prove the next theorem, mimic the approach you used to prove Theorem~\ref{thm:unique additive identity}.

\begin{theorem}
The multiplicative identity of $\mathbb{R}$ is unique.
\end{theorem}

For every $a\in\mathbb{R}$, the elements $-a$ and $a^{-1}$ (as long as $a\neq 0$) are also the unique \textbf{additive} and \textbf{multiplicative inverses}. 

\begin{theorem}
Every real number has a unique additive inverse.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
Every nonzero real number has a unique multiplicative inverse.
\end{theorem}

We now introduce some common notation that you are likely familiar with.  Take a moment to think about why the following is a definition as opposed to an axiom or theorem.

\begin{definition}
For every $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ and $n\in\mathbb{Z}$, we define the following:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textrm{(\alph*)}]
\item $a-b\coloneqq a+(-b)$
\item $\displaystyle\frac{a}{b}\coloneqq ab^{-1}$ (for $b\neq 0$)
\item $\displaystyle a^n\coloneqq \begin{cases}
\overbrace{aa\cdots a}^n, &\text{if }n\in \mathbb{N}\\
1, & \text{if }n=0\text{ and }a\neq 0\\
\displaystyle\frac{1}{a^{-n}}, & \text{if }-n\in \mathbb{N}\text{ and }a\neq 0
\end{cases}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Using the Field Axioms, we can prove each of the statements in the following theorem.  %However, we will take each for granted.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:consequences of axioms}
For all $a,b,c\in\mathbb{R}$, we have the following:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textrm{(\alph*)}]
\item $a=b$ if and only if $a+c=b+c$;
\item $0a=0$;
\item $-a=(-1)a$;
\item $(-1)^2 = 1$;
\item $-(-a)=a$;
\item If $a\neq 0$, then $(a^{-1})^{-1}=a$;
\item If $a\neq 0$ and $ab = ac$, then $b = c$.
\item If $ab=0$, then either $a=0$ or $b=0$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

Carefully prove the next theorem by explicitly citing where you are utilizing the Field Axioms and Theorem~\ref{thm:consequences of axioms}.

\begin{theorem}
For all $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$, we have $(a+b)(a-b)=a^2-b^2$.
\end{theorem}

We now introduce the Order Axioms of the real numbers.

\begin{orderaxioms}\label{axiom:order axioms}
For $a,b,c\in \mathbb{R}$, there is a relation $<$ on $\mathbb{R}$ satisfying:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(O1)] (Trichotomy Law) If $a\neq b$, then either $a<b$ or $b<a$ but not both;
\item[(O2)] (Transitivity) If $a<b$ and $b<c$, then $a<c$;
\item[(O3)] If $a<b$, then $a+c<b+c$;
\item[(O4)] If $a<b$ and $0<c$, then $ac<bc$;  
\end{enumerate}
\end{orderaxioms}

Given Axioms~(O1) and (O2) above, we say that the real numbers are \textbf{linearly ordered} (or \textbf{totally ordered}). We call numbers greater than zero \textbf{positive} and those greater than or equal to zero \textbf{nonnegative}. There are similar definitions for \textbf{negative} and \textbf{nonpositive}. 

Notice that the Order Axioms are phrased in terms of ``$<$". We would also like to be able to utilize ``$>$", ``$\leq$", and ``$\geq$".

\begin{definition}
For $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$, we define:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textrm{(\alph*)}]
\item $a>b$ if $b<a$;
\item $a\leq b$ if $a<b$ or $a=b$;
\item $a\geq b$ if $b\leq a$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Using the Order Axioms, we can prove many familiar facts. 

\begin{theorem}
For all $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$, if $a,b>0$, then $a+b>0$; and if $a,b<0$, then $a+b<0$.
\end{theorem}

The next result extends Axiom~(O3).

\begin{theorem}
For all $a,b,c,d\in\mathbb{R}$, if $a<b$ and $c<d$, then $a+c<b+d$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:additive inverse of a positive is negative}
For all $a\in\mathbb{R}$, $a>0$ if and only if $-a<0$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
If $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are positive real numbers such that $a<b$ and $c<d$, then $ac<bd$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
For all $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$, we have the following:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textrm{(\alph*)}]
\item $ab>0$ if and only if either $a,b>0$ or $a,b<0$;
\item $ab<0$ if and only if $a<0<b$ or $b<0<a$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
For all positive real numbers $a$ and $b$, $a< b$ if an only if $a^2< b^2$.
\end{theorem}

Consider using three cases when approaching the proof of the following theorem.

\begin{theorem}
For all $a\in\mathbb{R}$, we have $a^2\geq 0$.
\end{theorem}

It might come as a surprise that the following result requires proof.

\begin{theorem}
We have $0<1$.
\end{theorem}

The previous theorem together with Theorem~\ref{thm:additive inverse of a positive is negative} implies that $-1<0$ as you expect. It also follows from Axiom~(O3) that for all $n\in\mathbb{Z}$, we have $n<n+1$. We assume that there are no integers between $n$ and $n+1$.

\begin{theorem}
For all $a\in\mathbb{R}$, if $a>0$, then $a^{-1}>0$, and if $a<0$, then $a^{-1}<0$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:switch inequality using negative}
For all $a,b\in \mathbb{R}$, if $a<b$, then $-b<-a$. 
\end{theorem}

The last few results allow us to take for granted our usual understanding of which real numbers are positive and which are negative. The next theorem yields a result that extends Theorem~\ref{thm:switch inequality using negative}.

\begin{theorem}
For all $a,b,c\in \mathbb{R}$, if $a<b$ and $c<0$, then $bc<ac$. 
\end{theorem}

We could spend weeks building up from the axioms all of the necessary machinery for the real numbers. Instead we include a few additional axioms to save ourselves a little time.

\begin{additionalaxioms}\label{axiom:additional axioms}
The real numbers satisfy each of the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(O5)] For every $x\in\mathbb{R}$, there exists $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $a<x<b$;
\item[(O6)] For every $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$, if $a<b$, there exists $x\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $a<x<b$ (in particular, $\frac{a+b}{2}$ is between $a$ and $b$);
\item[(O7)]\label{axiom:archimedean} For every $a\in\mathbb{R}$, there exists $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $n \leq a < n + 1$.
\end{enumerate}	
\end{additionalaxioms}
  
Axiom~(O7) is sometimes referred to as the \textbf{Archimedean Property}. It turns out that we could derive this axiom from the \textbf{Completeness Axiom}, which we will introduce in the next sectiion.

\begin{theorem}
For any positive real number $a$, there exists $N\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $0<\frac{1}{N}<a$.
\end{theorem}

Notice that Axiom~(O5) says that every real number is contained in a finite open interval. In particular, Axiom~(O7) says that every non-integer is contained in an open interval with consecutive integer endpoints. Axiom~(O6) tells us that every open interval is nonempty. In fact, repeated applications of Axiom~(O6) implies that every open interval contains infinitely many points.

There is a special function that we can now introduce. 

\begin{definition}
Given $a\in\mathbb{R}$, we define the \textbf{absolute value of $a$}, denoted $|a|$, via
\[
|a|\coloneqq \begin{cases}
a, & \text{if }a\geq 0\\
-a, & \text{if }a<0.
\end{cases}
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
For all $a\in\mathbb{R}$, $|a|\geq 0$ with equality only if $a=0$.
\end{theorem}

In the next theorem, writing $\pm a\leq b$ is an abbreviation for $a\leq b$ and $-a\leq b$.

\begin{theorem}
For all $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$, if $\pm a\leq b$, then $|a|\leq b$. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
For all $a\in\mathbb{R}$, $|a|^2=a^2$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:plus minus less than or equal to abs value}
Prove that for all $a\in\mathbb{R}$, $\pm a\leq |a|$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:abs value less than or equal to iff squeezed by plus minus}
Prove that for all $a,r\in\mathbb{R}$, $|a|\leq r$ if and only if $-r\leq a\leq r$.
\end{theorem}

In the previous theorem, it must be the case that $r$ is nonnegative.  The letter $r$ was used because it is the first letter of the word ``radius". If $r$ is positive, we can think of the interval $(-r,r)$ as the interior of a 1-dimensional circle with radius $r$ centered at 0.

\begin{theorem}
For all $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$, $|ab|=|a||b|$.
\end{theorem}

Consider using Theorems~\ref{thm:plus minus less than or equal to abs value} and \ref{thm:abs value less than or equal to iff squeezed by plus minus} when attacking the next problem.  This result can be extremely useful in some contexts. 

\begin{theorem}[Triangle Inequality]
Prove that for all $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$, $|a+b|\leq |a|+|b|$.
\end{theorem}

The next theorem is related to the Triangle Inequality.

\begin{theorem}[Reverse Triangle Inequality]
Prove that for all $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$, $|a-b|\geq \left||a|-|b| \right|$.
\end{theorem}
